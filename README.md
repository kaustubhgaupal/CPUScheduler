# CPU Scheduling Simulator


A web-based interactive simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms, built with React. Visualize how different scheduling algorithms work with customizable processes and parameters.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports 6 scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
  - Shortest Job First (Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
  - Round Robin (with configurable quantum)

- **Interactive Gantt Chart**: Visual timeline showing process execution
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates and displays:
  - Completion times
  - Turnaround times
  - Waiting times
  - Average metrics
- **Customizable Processes**: Add/remove processes and configure:
  - Arrival times
  - Burst times
  - Priorities (for priority scheduling)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
